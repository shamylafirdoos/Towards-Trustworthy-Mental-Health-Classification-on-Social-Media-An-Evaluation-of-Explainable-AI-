Towards Trustworthy Mental Health Classification on Social Media

This project presents a trustworthy mental health classification framework for social media data using BERTweet and deep learning architectures. It integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to improve transparency, interpretability, and reliability of predictions.

📌 Overview

Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal ideation, bipolar disorder, and personality disorder are increasingly expressed on social media platforms. This project focuses on:

Accurate multiclass text classification

Transformer-based models (BERTweet)

Deep learning architectures (LSTM)

Explainable AI for model transparency

📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of 13k social media posts collected from multiple Kaggle sources


🧠 Models Used

BERT and its Variant

RNNs

🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)

To enhance trustworthiness, the project integrates:

SHAP  and LIME

Keyword importance highlighting

This helps interpret which words influence predictions.
